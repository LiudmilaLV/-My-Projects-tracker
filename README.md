"My Projects" web app
a simple project/time tracker.

Track your time spent on a project.

The idea behind the project is following. When you have worked on a project long enough (let's say you've been learning a new skill long enough), sometimes you reach a low point and feel unmotivated. In such moments I always find helpful looking back on all the progress I made. I used to use Exel sheets to check amount of minutes I spent learning languages several days a week. But I've decided to creat an app not only to enter my numbers and get the sums, but to graphically represent my progress, to set week goals and stay motivated.
When you are able to measure your progress somehow, you can stay inspired to work further, you know the success is not far. 
It's well known, when you spent several houndreds hours learning a skill, you can be sure your efforts were not in vain, you can be proud of yourself already and keep pushing forward.
You can set a goal like "spend 10 hours a week learning a new language" and expect to see some impressive results in just a few months (of hard work though). Cause it's said that with every 50-150 hours (depends on a lenguage) of quality studying time spent on that language you approach a new level of fluency (from 0 to C1 according to CEFRL). So tracking this time every day using this web app and watching the progress, while making small steps at a time, feels very rewarding.
